Why not start the week early with New York City’s longest running group skate, rolling since 1989! Empire Skate Club’s Tuesday Night Skate (TNS) is for high intermediate and advanced street skaters well accustomed to skating after dark and skating in traffic. It will be the most difficult skate of the week.

TNS rolls out at 8 PM. Meetup is 59th & Fifth in Manhattan. There may be an escort from the host hotel (TBD).

A typical route is usually 20 – 25 miles. Frequently visited destinations include places in the Bronx (the Reservoir or the Zoo), over the George Washington Bridge to NJ, Queens (the Unisphere), Brooklyn (Prospect Park or Red Hook), and upper Manhattan (the Cloisters).

The skate ends about 11:00pm at various local bars for food, drink and music.

Please wear appropriate protection, including a helmet and wrist guards. Light-colored or reflective clothing is very much recommended. Lights are also very helpful.
