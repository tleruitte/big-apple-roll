## Edit content

The website is generated from [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) files stored in the [`content/<current year>` directory](content/2024/).

Each file may contain a frontmatter header. The supported variables of the frontmatter header depends on the folder in which the file is stored.

These files can easily be edited directly on GitHub. Once the file is committed on GitHub, the website will be automatically updated a few minutes later. You can check the status of the build on the [Actions tab](/actions).
